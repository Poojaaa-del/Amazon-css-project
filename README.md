##Amazon.com Clone (Frontend Only)

This project is a clone of the Amazon.com website's frontend, 
built using only HTML and CSS. The goal is to replicate the 
basic structure and design of Amazon's homepage, product 
listings, and navigation elements, without any backend 
functionality or interactivity.

###Features:
<b>Homepage Layout:</b> Includes a navigation bar, search bar, and footer.
<b>Product Listings:</b> A grid-based layout to display product images, titles, and prices.
<b>Responsive Design:</b> The site adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring a smooth experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
<b>Styling:</b> The project uses CSS to style the elements and ensure a visually appealing user interface.

###Technologies:
<b>HTML:</b> Used for structuring the web pages.
<b>CSS:</b> Used for layout, styling, and responsiveness.

This project is purely focused on frontend design and is a 
great way to practice HTML and CSS skills while mimicking a 
popular e-commerce platform's look and feel.
